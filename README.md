# simple-portfolio

About:
  This is the home of my launchpad into the developer world. When I first prepared to build my portfolio I was torn over how to build it. My first attempts were straight forward clean builds. This led to a few scrapped projects. Plain and boring work is only done upon request. This caused a decision to put not only my abilities on display, but to also show my personality.
