        <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
        <p>
          With over 20 years of freelance work in UI Design in areas of
          ECommerce as well as building layouts for Wordpress. Working with
          HTML, CSS, and Photoshop for specialized graphics. That experience has
          helped to have a discerning eye and proficiency when it comes to
          development.

        <p>
          I am a constant knowledge seeker always looking to expand my skill set
          whether it be to expand my current skills, or to add new languages or
          libraries to my toolbox. I am ready and willing to be molded to the
          needs of the team.

        <h1>About This Site</h1>
        <p>
          All the sites/apps showcased here have a small writeup about it, and I
          feel the portfolio site should be no different. After all this site is
          not a class project, not from a follow along tutorial, but something
          built from my skills, and imagination. When the planning for this site
          began I decided to go back to the basics. It is built with good old
          fashion HTML, CSS, and some honest to goodness wholesome vanilla
          JavaScript. No libraries, frameworks, bootstraps, or dependencies to
          be found here. There is also just a dash of PHP for the contact form
          mail handeler. Currently I do not have a backend deployed for this
          site, but have plans to add a GraphQL/MongoDB backend just for the
          practice. If you have any questions or would be interested in my
          resume checkout the contact page.

        Please be patent as many of these apps are hosted on Heroku, and the
        server needs time to wakeup.
